# ADO.NET Project Repository

This repository contains code demonstrating and exploring various aspects of ADO.NET (ActiveX Data Objects for .NET) for data access in .NET applications. ADO.NET provides a framework for connecting to data sources and working with data.

## Overview

This project aims to provide practical examples and utilities for common ADO.NET tasks, including:

* **Connecting to different data sources:** Demonstrations for connecting to SQL Server, SQLite, and potentially other databases.
* **Executing commands:** Examples of executing SQL queries and stored procedures.
* **Retrieving data:** Showing how to read data using `SqlDataReader`, `DataAdapter`, and `DataSet`/`DataTable`.
* **Parameterization:** Best practices for using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
* **Transactions:** Implementing and managing database transactions for data integrity.
* **Error Handling:** Demonstrating proper exception handling for database operations.
* **Disconnected Data:** Working with `DataSet` and `DataTable` for scenarios where continuous database connection is not required.
* **Entity Framework Core (Brief Overview/Comparison):** Potentially includes a basic comparison or integration with EF Core as a more modern ORM.
* **Custom Exception Handling:** Examples of creating and using custom data access exceptions.

## Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories (subject to change as the project evolves):
